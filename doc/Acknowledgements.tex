This package is the product of my activities on R\&D of CMOS pixel sensors within the PICSEL group at IPHC Strasbourg in the context of the ILD vertex detector
optimization. I am grateful for the useful discussions with the members of the PICSEL group M. Winter, J. Baudot and A. Besson. I also would like to acknowledge the 
useful feedback from the ILD vertex detector community. Finally, I would like to thank I. Belikov from the ALICE group at IPHC Strasbourg for the long discussions 
about the implementation of subtle calculations performed in this package.
