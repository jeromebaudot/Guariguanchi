\section{Summary and outlook}
\label{sec:Summary}

{\guari} is a standalone package meant for fast calculations of tracking performances in terms of track parameters resolution, tracking pseudo-efficiency and material budget.
In its current state a set of simple geometries and magnetic fields can be implement, but which cover most of the applications in the realm of particle and nuclear physics.
A full description of the code structure has been given as well as guide-lines to extend the code to cover further applications. We expect that this tool box will be useful in 
the process of geometry optimization for applications in domains where charged particle tracking is an important feature of the experimental setup. {\guari} package is a free-sourced 
software and any improvements to it are more than welcome.
